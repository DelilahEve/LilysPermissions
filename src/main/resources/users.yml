# Users (players) recorded here can be provided with overriding properties.
# It's recommended to read through permissions.yml before going over this file.
#
# Users do not have to be recorded here if they're only being given default
# permissions (though you can configure the plugin such that all players are).
#
# Users who are given non-default groups are automatically recorded here and
# should not be removed otherwise the plugin will forget any groups they've
# been assigned.
#
# If you wish to use colours/formatting you may use any of these replacement keys:
#
# Black ---------- &0    Green ------------ &a    Italic --------- &o
# Dark Blue ------ &1    Aqua ------------- &b    Reset ---------- &r
# Dark Green ----- &2    Red -------------- &c
# Dark Aqua ------ &3    Light Purple ----- &d
# Dark Red ------- &4    Yellow ----------- &e
# Dark Purple ---- &5    White ------------ &f
# Gold ----------- &6    Magic ------------ &k
# Gray ----------- &7    Bold ------------- &l
# Dark Gray ------ &8    Strikethrough ---- &m
# Blue ----------- &9    Underline -------- &n
#
# Use of replacement keys requires wrapping the entire string in "", otherwise
# the YAML will fail to parse. If you need to validate your file you can use

#
# These formatting keys are Bukkit's ChatColor values and can be found in their
# documentation. These values are standard to all Bukkit-based servers including
# Spigot and Paper.

  # User's entry, should be their UUID. If you need to find a UUID for a player

  # This entry is for Dinnerbone, and whilst it's a very low chance he'd join
  # your server at random, it'd be good security to remove this entry as it's
  # only for demonstration. If you do remove it, place [] after the "users" node
  # to ensure the file formatting remains valid.
