# Users (players) recorded here can be provided with overriding properties.
# It's recommended to read through permissions.yml before going over this file.
#
# Users do not have to be recorded here if they're only being given default
# permissions (though you can configure the plugin such that all players are).
# Users who are given non-default groups are automatically recorded here and
# should not be removed otherwise the plugin will forget any groups they've
# been assigned.

  # User's entry, should be their UUID. If you need to find a UUID for a player
  # to manually add them, you can use: https://mcuuid.net/

  # This entry is for Dinnerbone, and whilst it's a very low chance he'd join
  # your server at random, it'd be good security to remove this entry.
